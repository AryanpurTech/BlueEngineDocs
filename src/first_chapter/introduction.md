# Introduction

Here lives the guide for the [Blue Engine](https://github.com/ElhamAryanpur/BlueEngine), including examples, tips, tricks, philosophy, and more.

The early idea for this project was to use this engine as the first layer for all future projects of myself, but later was decided that it should be made for general use. Now the engine can be used for games, GUIs, or even as a render backend.

Although the engine is quite young in terms of development, the main focus is stability, flexibility, ease of use, and portability. The engine is actively used in my projects and [Gigantesque](https://github.com/Gigantesque)!

We do have a small community as of now, mainly on [discord](https://discord.gg/s7xsj9q). So join us if you haven't yet!.
