# Introduction

Here lives the guide for the [Blue Engine](https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngine), including examples, tips, tricks, philosophy, and more. This guide will go in depth through the engine with examples and opinions on the engine mechanics. This guide is updated to version `0.5.1` of the engine.

The early idea for this project was to use this engine as the first layer for all future projects of myself, but later was decided that it should be made for general use. Now the engine can be used for games, GUIs, or even as a render backend.

Although the engine is quite young in terms of development, the main focus is small footprint, stability, flexibility, ease of use, and portability. The engine should not force your hand into a certain way, rather be usable for both new and veteren devs.

We do have a small community as of now, mainly on [discord](https://discord.gg/s7xsj9q). So join us if you haven't yet!.
