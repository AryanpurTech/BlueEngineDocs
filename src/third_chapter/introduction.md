# Example projects

Let's make an example project, we'll start from the basics and go deep as time goes.

In the end you'll learn how to:

* create window and modify it

* add objects to the scene

* modify objects and give them movement

* add many objects and move all of them

* add gui (use optional featues in the engine)

* interop gui with the scene
